## Code Overview

This project is a JavaScript-based documentation website and includes both the back-end and front-end of the website at [lbry.tech](https://lbry.tech).

### Back-End

Node.js + [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io) handle the back-end of this site. All back-end functionality is in one file, [server.js](server.js). Additionally, the back-end works as a proxy for some basic LBRY daemon method calls at `daemon.lbry.tech`.

### Front-End

[choo](https://choo.io) handles the front-end of this site. Sass files are automatically compiled when edited.
